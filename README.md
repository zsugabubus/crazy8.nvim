# crazy8.nvim

NeoVim plugin that automatically configures `'tabstop'`, `'shiftwidth'`,
`'softtabstop'` and `'expandtab'`. Forget about modelines now and forever.

---

- Uses **AI**, written in pure Lua for maximum performance.
- Requires **no configuration**, since everything that the plugin should know
  is inside the buffers.
- Set defaults as easy as `au FileType c setlocal ts=8`.
