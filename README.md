# crazy8.nvim

NeoVim plugin that automagically configures `'tabstop'`, `'shiftwidth'`,
`'softtabstop'` and `'expandtab'`.

Currently comes with no configuration options. It silently sits in the
background and does its job when needed.

## Final words

Plugin works but it may be too smart about `'tabstop'`. Personally, I started
using
[vim-dent](https://github.com/zsugabubus/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim/pack/plugins/opt/vim-dent)
that I'm quite happy with: fast and perfect (for me so far).
