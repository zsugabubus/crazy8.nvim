# crazy8.nvim

NeoVim plugin that automagically configures `'tabstop'`, `'shiftwidth'`,
`'softtabstop'` and `'expandtab'`.

Currently comes with no configuration options. It silently sits in the
background and does its job when needed.

## Bugs

If you experience any misdetections, do not hesitate to file an issue.

###### Oh, do not get scared. It potentially occurs only with purely tab-aligned “specially crafted” files… if occurs.
